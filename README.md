# Virtual Event Logistics


### Set up a way for your participants to communicate digitally and stay in touch after the event. Some options are:

- A chat room, like [Discord](https://discord.com/)
- A social media channel, like a hashtag on Twitter, Instagram or a Facebook group
- A shared document space, like Google Docs
- An email list, like a Google Group

### Think about how you will tell your story
Part of your eventâ€™s lasting impact is in how people will remember it:

- Choose a hashtag.
- Think about how to take capture moments of your hackathon that tell its story.
- Read MIT blog about [media-making strategies](https://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/media-making-strategies-to-support-community-and-learning-at-hackathons) for hackathons.
